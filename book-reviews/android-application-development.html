<p>
This software development reference book is supposedly aimed at the
experienced developer. The authors’ aim was to cover practical app
development using several important topics in depth, such as; basic
architectural components, the app lifecycle, setting up and debugging
an Android project, UI, Intents, Location-based services, Persistence
with SQLite, Graphics, and Communications. To further explain app
development they used the standard template app that is then developed
further using what you had learned within each chapter.
<p>
The book is broken up into two main sections. The first is an overview
of Android and how to set up and debug a software project. The second is
a series of in-depth chapters on a particular topic. 
<p>
The first section has a good practical slant focussed on setting up an
Android project in Eclipse and showing how to debug it. The book explains
what can go wrong and also what to do when these eventualities arise.
<p>
However, I found each topical chapter in section two a little light on
content; each chapter more an introductory description than for experienced
developers who need deep insights into the various working parts of the
APIs and architecture. Each section took you through the basic workings
and showed how to perform the basic tasks. They were fairly rich in detail.
However, I felt the descriptions of how things worked were only enough
to cover the app they were using as an example. I did not feel that this
coverage was comprehensive.
<p>
As I worked through the book several things irked me. The authors said that
you must look for more in-depth reference material online, however did not
give any indication where this would be. Further, to use only a meagre
300-odd pages to cover all the topics described above did not give a lot
of room to explain each topic fully.
<p>
This book is good but more of an overview of Android. I do not believe
it will give you a complete understanding of the platform, or help you
solve complicated issues that stand outside the basic architecture of
Intents and Activities.
